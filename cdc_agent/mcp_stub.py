MCP (Model Context Protocol) Client/Server Stub

This file demonstrates how the CDC Health Agent could integrate with the open Model Context Protocol.
See: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction

In a production system, this agent could expose its RAG or retrieval capabilities as an MCP Server,
or consume external tools and data via an MCP Client.

Below is a stub class to show how the integration point would be structured.

class MCPServerStub:
    def __init__(self):
        # In a real implementation, you'd set up socket/webserver endpoints per MCP spec
        pass

    def handle_context_request(self, context_request):
        # Parse incoming MCP context requests (JSON-RPC, HTTP, etc.)
        # Route to agent, perform retrieval, return results as MCP response object
        # (See MCP "Resources" and "Tools" in the docs)
        return {"result": "Stub: MCP context handled", "request": context_request}

    def serve(self):
        print("MCP server would start here (stub). Ready to accept MCP protocol requests.")

# Example usage (not called by default)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = MCPServerStub()
    server.serve()
    # Test a context request
    print(server.handle_context_request({"topic": "flu", "question": "What are the symptoms of flu?"}))
