The flu and COVID-19 are both respiratory illnesses caused by viruses. However, they are caused by different viruses and have some differences in symptoms and severity. The flu is caused by the influenza virus, while COVID-19 is caused by the coronavirus. Both can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, and body aches, but COVID-19 may also cause loss of taste or smell and can lead to more severe illness, especially in older adults and those with underlying health conditions. The flu has a vaccine available to help prevent it, while there is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. Prevention measures for both include washing hands frequently, wearing masks, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals. It is important to seek medical attention if you have symptoms of either illness.
