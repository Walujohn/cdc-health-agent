CDC Health Advisory Agent

A proof-of-concept Python agentic app for retrieving and summarizing authoritative CDC health guidance using LangGraph, RAG, and tool integration.
Built to demonstrate agentic orchestration, RAG, MLOps, and cloud readiness (Google Vertex AI, MLflow, LangSmith) for engineering experiments and real-world production.

üöÄ Features

Agentic Workflow: Multi-step orchestration with LangGraph.

CDC.gov Retrieval: Live health guidance from official CDC sources.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Semantic chunking and vector search with OpenAI (or Vertex AI ready).

Experiment Tracking: MLflow for local experiment tracking, easily swappable to Vertex AI or other platforms.

LLM Prompt Tracing: LangSmith for prompt/response and workflow logging.

Cloud/MLOps Ready: Code stubs for Google Vertex AI, Docker, and cloud deployment.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
  1. Clone and Set Up
      git clone https://github.com/Walujohn/cdc-health-agent.git
    
      cd cdc-health-agent
      
      python3 -m venv venv
      
      source venv/bin/activate
      
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  3. Set Environment Variables

      export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # OpenAI API key
      
      export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
      
      export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="lsm_..." # LangSmith API key
      
      export LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
      
      export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="cdc-agent"
      
      export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://localhost:5000" 
      
      Tip: Add these to your .bashrc and run source ~/.bashrc.
  
  5. Start MLflow Tracking UI (optional but recommended)
  
      mlflow ui
  
      Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
  
  6. Run the Agent
     
      python -m cdc_agent.agent
  
     üí° Sample Questions
      
      ‚ÄúWhat are the symptoms of flu?‚Äù
      
      ‚ÄúWhat does the CDC say about mpox vaccines?‚Äù
      
      ‚ÄúHow is COVID-19 spread?‚Äù

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud/MLOps and Vertex AI Readiness

Experiment Tracking: MLflow is integrated locally; can be configured for Vertex AI Metadata or cloud MLflow.

LLM/Embeddings: Easily swap OpenAI for Vertex AI endpoints with minimal code change.

Production Deployment: Docker-ready; can be run as a Cloud Run or Vertex AI custom job/container.

Vertex AI Example Stub:

  from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel
  
  model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("textembedding-gecko@latest")
  
  embeddings = model.get_embeddings(["your text here"])
  
  from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel
  
  model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison@001")
  
  response = model.predict("Summarize this CDC content:\n" + context)
  
  print(response.text)

üìù For Interviewers

See cdc_agent/agent.py for workflow logic, experiment tracking, and logging.

See cdc_agent/tools/cdc_scraper.py for the CDC.gov retrieval tool.

Architecture is MLOps/cloud-ready for enterprise deployment.

‚ú® Future Extensions

Vertex AI/Gemini/Anthropic endpoint support

Slack, email, or SMS notifications

Batch processing or scheduled runs

Docker Compose for agent + tracking server

üë©‚Äçüíª Accessibility & Fullstack Experience

I am a certified accessibility tester and have professional experience ensuring web applications meet WCAG and Section 508 standards.

I have extensive Ruby on Rails and fullstack development experience alongside Python and AI/ML work.

I care deeply about accessible, inclusive AI interfaces and would prioritize accessible UX, ARIA best practices, and automated/manual accessibility testing in any production deployment.

See the code example below for a quick accessibility markup stub.
Accessibility would be a core focus of any future UI.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>CDC Health Agent ‚Äì Accessible Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>CDC Health Agent ‚Äì Accessible Demo</h1>
    <form aria-labelledby="cdc-question-label">
      <label id="cdc-question-label" for="question">
        Ask a CDC health question:
      </label>
      <input type="text" id="question" name="question" aria-required="true" />
      <button type="submit">Ask</button>
    </form>
    <section aria-live="polite">
      <!-- The agent's answer would appear here -->
      <p id="answer" tabindex="0"></p>
    </section>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

üß† Model Selection Principles

This project is designed for easy model swapping and selection.
In production, I would evaluate models based on:

Cost (e.g., per-token or per-request pricing)

Latency (response time requirements)

Quality/Accuracy (‚ÄúBrains‚Äù‚Äîhow complex the reasoning or summarization must be)

Examples:

For fast, high-volume Q&A: OpenAI GPT-3.5 or Vertex AI Gemini Pro

For more nuanced/critical answers: GPT-4, Gemini Ultra, or a fine-tuned Llama/Claude

For compliance/data residency: Enterprise endpoints (Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, or Azure OpenAI)

The project‚Äôs structure (see agent.py) allows swapping LLM endpoints or embedding models with minimal changes.

Testing

Run pytest tests/ to verify basic routing and utility functions.

**Note on Interview-Inspired Improvements**

This POC reflects direct feedback from a technical interview.  
Key enhancements address:

- Agentic link-following and navigation (multi-page CDC content scraping)
- Multi-vector database RAG (retrieves from multiple FAISS indexes)
- Pluggable LLM provider adapter (OpenAI, Vertex AI, Anthropic)
- API-first code stubs and production comments

For details, see the implementation and comments in `cdc_agent/tools/cdc_scraper.py` and `cdc_agent/llm.py`.
