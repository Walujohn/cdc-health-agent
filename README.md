CDC Health Advisory Agent
A proof-of-concept Python agentic app for retrieving and summarizing authoritative CDC health guidance using LangGraph, RAG, and tool integration.
Built to demonstrate agentic orchestration, RAG, MLOps, and cloud readiness (Google Vertex AI, MLflow, LangSmith) for engineering experiments and real-world production.

üöÄ Features
Agentic Workflow: Multi-step orchestration with LangGraph.

CDC.gov Retrieval: Live health guidance from official CDC sources.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Semantic chunking and vector search with OpenAI (or Vertex AI ready).

Experiment Tracking: MLflow for local experiment tracking, easily swappable to Vertex AI or other platforms.

LLM Prompt Tracing: LangSmith for prompt/response and workflow logging.

Cloud/MLOps Ready: Code stubs for Google Vertex AI, Docker, and cloud deployment.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
1. Clone and Set Up
git clone https://github.com/Walujohn/cdc-health-agent.git
cd cdc-health-agent
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Set Environment Variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." # OpenAI API key
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="lsm_..." # LangSmith API key
export LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="cdc-agent"
export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://localhost:5000"

Tip: Add these to your .bashrc and run source ~/.bashrc.

3. Start MLflow Tracking UI (optional but recommended)
mlflow ui

Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

4. Run the Agent
python -m cdc_agent.agent

üí° Sample Questions
‚ÄúWhat are the symptoms of flu?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does the CDC say about mpox vaccines?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is COVID-19 spread?‚Äù

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud/MLOps and Vertex AI Readiness
Experiment Tracking: MLflow is integrated locally; can be configured for Vertex AI Metadata or cloud MLflow.

LLM/Embeddings: Easily swap OpenAI for Vertex AI endpoints with minimal code change.

Production Deployment: Docker-ready; can be run as a Cloud Run or Vertex AI custom job/container.

Vertex AI Example Stub:

from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel
model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("textembedding-gecko@latest")
embeddings = model.get_embeddings(["your text here"])
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel
model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained("text-bison@001")
response = model.predict("Summarize this CDC content:\n" + context)
print(response.text)

üìù For Interviewers
See cdc_agent/agent.py for workflow logic, experiment tracking, and logging.

See cdc_agent/tools/cdc_scraper.py for the CDC.gov retrieval tool.

Architecture is MLOps/cloud-ready for enterprise deployment.
